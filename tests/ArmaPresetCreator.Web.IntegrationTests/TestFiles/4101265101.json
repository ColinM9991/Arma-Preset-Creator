The FAL largely was considered a hit, with the British Commonwealth adopting or manufacturing variants (generally known as the SLR), Brazil, Austria and adopting it as main infantry rifles, and swathes of small contract purchases thoughout it's lifetime. IMBEL continues production of the FAL to this day, effectively unchanged from it's original configuration alongside variants that modernise the platform, and in the civilian realm DS Arms produces FAL and SLR build for the shooter that range from the mundane SLR to Dedicated marksman platforms and the peculiar OSW. \r\n\r\nThe SLR in here was actually one of the first things I tried my hand at in Arma modding. No joke I have images from 2 weeks post launch of the Alpha with the SLR in. Kind of pleased with how far even a year brings all this along\r\n\r\nContains\r\n=======\r\n8 Rifles\r\n2 Scopes\r\n1 Suppressor\r\nCompliment of magazines\r\n1 Ammo Crate with everything a FAL needs\r\n\r\nClassnames\r\n==========\r\nhlc_rifle_l1a1slr   - Enfield L1A1 SLR\r\nhlc_rifle_SLR   - Lithgow SLR (Australian manufactured L1A1)\r\nhlc_rifle_STG58F   - Steyr STG.58 \r\nhlc_rifle_FAL5061   - FN FAL 'Para' \r\nhlc_rifle_c1A1   - FN C1A1 (Canadian SLR variant, manufactured by FN)\r\nhlc_rifle_LAR   - FN LAR (Light infantry rifle contracted to Israel, Differs from the Support variant by the omission of bipod and standard width barrel)\r\nhlc_rifle_SLRchopmod - Lithgow SLR Chopmod ( Litghow SLR with the selector group from an L2A1 , Barrel sawn down and flash suppressor omitted, additional pistol grip drilled to foregrip.
