It is a system that:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Offers a range of features for addon-makers and mission designers.\r\n[*]Aims to have community wide acceptance and to be used as much as possible by community addons to maintain compatibility.\r\n[*]The community is very much encouraged to request or submit functionality.\r\n[*]The most obvious example would be to submit functions to be included in the CBA function library.\r\n[/list]\r\n[u][b]Documentation[/b][/u]\r\nFull documentation is available at [url=https://cbateam.github.io/CBA_A3/docs/files/overview-txt.html]GitHub[/url] \r\n\r\n[u][b]Licensed Under GPLv2[/b][/u]\r\nAny addon which calls CBA-defined functions need not be licensed under the GPLv2\r\nor released under a free software license. Only if you are directly including CBA code\r\nin your addon's binarized PBO or redistributing a modified version of CBA itself would\r\nyour work be considered derivative and therefore be legally required to be released under\r\nthe terms of the GPL. (And there's no reason to ever do either of these.)\r\n",
